# JSON Packer
Welcome to my JSON Packer Task ! This is a brief guide to help you get started.

# Building the Project
To build the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
make all
```
This will compile the source code and create an executable file. You can find the executable file in the build directory.

> **_NOTE:_**  This program requires Apache portable runtime , Json-c , CUnit 
```bash
sudo apt-get install libapr1 libapr1-dev
sudo apt-get install libjson-c-dev
sudo apt-get install libcunit1 libcunit1-doc libcunit1-dev
```


# Running the Program
To run the program, navigate to the build directory and execute the following command:


```bash

./jsonparcker

```
Before running the program, please make sure that you have an =="input.json"==  (you will find an example in assets folder) file in same level with program. The program will read the data from this file and generate the output file in the same directory.

# Testing the Program
To run the automated tests, execute the following command:

```bash
make test
```

This will run all of the tests in the tests directory and display the results on the screen.

# Debug Mode
By default, the program runs in debug mode, which displays additional information on the screen. If you want to disable debug mode, you can simply undefine DEBUG_MODE in the main.h header file.
